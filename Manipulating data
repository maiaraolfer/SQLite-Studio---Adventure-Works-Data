-- Data manipulation
-- using LEFT JOIN to bind Sales data with Customer information into a new table
CREATE TABLE SalesWithCustomerInfo AS
SELECT *
FROM SalesData_All
LEFT JOIN CustomerLookup_copy
    ON SalesData_All.CustomerKey=CustomerLookup_copy.CustomerKey;

-- using some commands to get information from customer John Thomas
SELECT *
FROM SalesWithCustomerInfo
WHERE FirstName COLLATE NOCASE = "john" AND LastName COLLATE NOCASE = "thomas";
-- COLLATE NOCASE tells SQL to ignora case when comparing strings.

-- But it is also possible to put everything in lower case:
SELECT *
FROM SalesWithCustomerInfo
WHERE LOWER(FirstName)  = "john" AND LOWER(LastName) = "thomas";

--
SELECT *
FROM SalesWithCustomerInfo
WHERE OrderDate = '2020-01-01'; --datas devem ser escritas entre aspas

-- consultando total de vendas por mes.
SELECT 
  strftime('%Y-%m', OrderDate) AS YearMonth, -- extrai o ano e mes
  SUM(OrderQuantity) AS TotalSales --soma das vendas as TotalSale
FROM SalesData_All
GROUP BY YearMonth -- group by Year-Month
ORDER BY YearMonth; -- order by Year-Month
